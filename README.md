Trained Machine learning forecasting algorithms including ARIMA, LSTM, Facebook Prophet, SVM, and
AutoTS were trained and employed to determine the optimal Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The
analysis revealed that ARIMA yielded the lowest RMSE and exhibited superior performance for long-term
forecasts in comparison to the other models. (Python)
